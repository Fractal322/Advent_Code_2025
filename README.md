This repository contains solutions for puzzle 1, puzzle 2, and puzzle 3 from Advent of Code 2025, implemented using a hardware-based approach.

Each folder includes four types of files: a README file with a description of the solution, SystemVerilog design files, SystemVerilog testbench files, and text input files used by the testbenches.
Design files follow the format puzzle<puzzle_number>_<part>.sv.
Testbench files follow the format puzzle<puzzle_number>_<part>_tb.sv.
Text input files follow the format puzzle<puzzle_number>_<part>.txt.

All solutions were tested in Vivado(using generated wareforms with tcl console), and all designs are synthesizable.
